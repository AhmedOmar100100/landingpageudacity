# Landing Page Project

This is my first project, and my hope is to be successful in using the tools that I learned to implement 

I have added the sections using JavaScript.

I created a function to create a link for each section.

and make Modification to the active class properties for both section and link.

I made an icon to go to the top of the page.

I made a button for creating the additional partitions.

I made the icon appear after scaling to 800 pixels.

I made the link header that disappear after 8 seconds and reappear with just a scroll.
